It aims to turn film screenings from passive viewing to active learning experiences by connecting personal reflection to social responsibility through its Showing-Synthesis-Social Action framework. The program is mainly implemented through a web-based app which features a catalog of regional short films with accompanying study guides created by volunteers. The online platform is a community learning environment where teachers and students can learn about the filmâ€™s creative and social values and be prompted to do civic engagement through volunteering.\n\nWhile this educational technology requires internet connectivity, the program provides an offline alternative to reach underserved communities. We do this through a Skwela Salida Ambassador course. It is a 2-day intensive workshop wherein teachers are trained how to use the films and the lessons using the Skwela Salida framework in schools and communities without having to use the web-app.\n\nThe donation will be used to subsidize the first cohort of 20-25 teachers from the Davao region. The fund will be used to pay for rental of workshop space, meals, and teaching materials."
